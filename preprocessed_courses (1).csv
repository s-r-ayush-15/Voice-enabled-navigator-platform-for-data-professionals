Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-table-sql-queries,"In this course you�ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language.   We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts�   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you�re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It�s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That�s called �data retrieval�.   Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as �the language of relational databases�. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper.   You�ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio.   Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it�s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you�ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Preparing for the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Exam,https://www.coursera.org/learn/preparing-cloud-professional-data-engineer-exam,"From the course: ""The best way to prepare for the exam is to be competent in the skills required of the job.""  This course uses a top-down approach to recognize knowledge and skills already known, and to surface information and skill areas for additional preparation. You can use this course to help create your own custom preparation plan. It helps you distinguish what you know from what you don't know. And it helps you develop and practice skills required of practitioners who perform this job.  The course follows the organization of the Exam Guide outline, presenting highest-level concepts, ""touchstones"", for you to determine whether you feel confident about your knowledge of that area and its dependent concepts, or if you want more study. You also will learn about and have the opportunity to practice key job skills, including cognitive skills such as case analysis, identifying technical watchpoints, and developing proposed solutions. These are job skills that are also exam skills. You will also test your basic abilities with Activity Tracking Challenge Labs. And you will have many sample questions similar to those on the exam, including solutions. The end of the course contains an ungraded practice exam quiz, followed by a graded practice exam quiz that simulates the exam-taking experience.  New!

Teaching Children with Visual Impairment: Creating Empowering Classrooms,https://www.coursera.org/learn/teach-children-with-visual-impairment,"In the education of children with visual impairment, there is at present a global movement away from segregated special schooling, and towards inclusive neighbourhood schools. Inclusion provides an opportunity for everyone, teachers as well as learners, to become more acquainted about life with visual impairment and to overcome some of the barriers of difference which have existed in the past. But if it is to be successful, teachers and others require key skills and insights in order to create classroom environments which fully accommodate the learning needs of children with visual impairment. In this course, you will discover the visually impaired child by recognizing that there are many different eye conditions and that each affects learning and behavior differently. During the course, we will explore the Expanded Core Curriculum, which is a collection of content areas that teachers integrate into the core curriculum to give visually impaired learners access to knowledge that sighted learners gain through observation.

Building Containerized Applications on AWS,https://www.coursera.org/learn/containerized-apps-on-aws,"This course introduces you to container technologies and how they can be used to modernize your applications, as well as exploring how different AWS services can be used to manage and orchestrate those containers.  Container technologies have existed for years, and are still gaining popularity. Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?  AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.  This course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.",4.0,14.5 total hours,Beginner,Paid,build container applic aw,cours introduc contain technolog use modern applic well explor differ aw servic use manag orchestr contain contain technolog exist year still gain popular two preval option docker kubernet distinct set featur regardless technolog choos one biggest challeng contain orchestr unlik tradit monolith applic scale macro level execut exampl container applic scale contain level coupl microservic approach contain contain code necessari execut singl task function provid number benefit singl applic consist hundr container microservic handl start stop scale scale contain aw offer number servic help contain orchestr includ amazon elast contain servic ec amazon elast kubernet servic ek amazon lightsail amazon elast contain registri ecr throughout cours expert instructor dive deep servic well gener contain technolog capabl cours use combin video base lectur deliv aw technic trainer demonstr hand lab exercis enabl deploy manag container applic

A Journey through Western Christianity: from Persecuted Faith to Global Religion (200 - 1650),https://www.coursera.org/learn/western-christianity-200-1650,"This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther�s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.   We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas� great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin�s Geneva to Elizabeth�s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.   Christianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God�s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy.

Supply Chain Management: A Learning Perspective,https://www.coursera.org/learn/supply-chain-management,"As a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27� LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain.   For the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it!   In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving.",4.7,18 total hours,Beginner,Paid,suppli chain manag learn perspect,human consum product servic time morn got ate breakfast e g egg milk bread fresh fruit like breakfast drove car work school offic use comput perhap equip 27 lcd monitor break drank cup coffe play iphon forth probabl take grant enjoy product take closer look product made eventu deliv realiz one short miracl exampl fruit like consid fresh strawberri order strawberri breakfast tabl must numer function activ transact peopl involv plant cultiv deliv consum strawberri moreov function activ transact peopl connect integr chain physic product like strawberri virtual element inform commun flow back forth constantli group relat function activ suppli chain compris four primari function supplier manufactur distributor final consum suppli chain essenti valu chain societi economi whole goal maxim valu e creat satisfactori valu without spend much order creat maximum valu strawberri suppli chain everi particip chain must carri function effici addit member must coordin effect order ensur valu maxim face issu almost product servic take grant everyday life e g car hamburg haircut surgeri movi bank restaur name cours want understand fundament principl valu creation consum market tri answer question like product servic made valu creat activ function coordin play leadership role realiz cours titl hint approach issu learn perspect dynam natur emphas long term capabl build rather short term symptomat problem solv

A Circular Economy of Metals: Towards a Sustainable Societal Metabolism,https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy-metals,"Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.    A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.    In this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.    This course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.",4.7,9.5 total hours,Beginner,Paid,circular economi metal toward sustain societ metabol,metal present everywher around us one major materi upon economi built econom develop deepli coupl use metal 20th centuri varieti metal applic societi grew rapidli addit mass applic steel build aluminium plane differ metal use innov technolog use special metal indium lcd screen lot metal need futur easi provid particular emerg economi also industrialis countri demand metal increas rapidli mine product activ expand also environment consequ metal product cours explor consequ also explor option move toward sustain system metal product use focu especi option reach circular economi metal keep metal use long time avoid mine new one cours base report global metal flow group intern resourc panel part un environ import aspect come back week un sustain develop goal sdg ambiti goal measur progress toward sustain world use sdg touch stone assess metal challeng well solut present cours solv challeng

Strategy and Sustainability,https://www.coursera.org/learn/strategy-sustainability,"Business and environmental sustainability are not natural bedfellows. Business is about making money. Sustainability is about protecting the planet. Business is measured in months and quarters. Sustainability often requires significant short term costs to secure a sometimes uncertain long-term benefit. To some activists, all executives are exploitative, selfish one percenters. To some executives, all activists are irresponsible, unyielding extremists.   And yet engaging with the issue isn�t optional � all businesses must have a strategy to deal with sustainability and, like any strategy, this involves making choices.   This Strategy and Sustainability course based on Rosenberg's recently published book by Palgrave (http://www.palgrave.com/la/book/9781137501738) that encourages learners to filter out the noise and make those choices in a hard-nosed and clear-eyed way. Prof. Rosenberg�s nuanced and fact-based point of view recognizes the complexity of the issues at hand and the strategic choices businesses must make. He blends the work of some of the leading academic thinkers in the field with practical examples from a variety of business sectors and geographies and offers a framework with which senior management might engage with the topic, not (just) to save the planet but to fulfill their short, medium and long-term responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders.  This course promises to be both engaging and thought-provoking, aimed at anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of a subject that is no longer perceived as a choice but a necessity for future managers and business leaders alike.",4.2,4 total hours,Beginner,Paid,strategi sustain,busi environment sustain natur bedfellow busi make money sustain protect planet busi measur month quarter sustain often requir signific short term cost secur sometim uncertain long term benefit activist execut exploit selfish one percent execut activist irrespons unyield extremist yet engag issu option busi must strategi deal sustain like strategi involv make choic strategi sustain cours base rosenberg recent publish book palgrav http www palgrav com la book 9781137501738 encourag learner filter nois make choic hard nose clear eye way prof rosenberg nuanc fact base point view recogn complex issu hand strateg choic busi must make blend work lead academ thinker field practic exampl varieti busi sector geographi offer framework senior manag might engag topic save planet fulfil short medium long term respons sharehold stakehold cours promis engag thought provok aim anyon wish gain deeper understand subject longer perceiv choic necess futur manag busi leader alik

It plays such a crucial role that there are people called Database Administrators that specialize in just organizing the data. The traditional database used to be, and often still is, a relational database. MySQL is one of the most popular relational databases and is backed by the Oracle corporation as well. This provides the developer with a variety of online resources. The popularity of MySQL combined with the popularity of Python has resulted in the development of an API that makes the interface between Python and MySQL almost seamless.  In this course, you will create a Python application using Python�s MySQL Connector that creates a MySQL database containing words and their definitions. You will then retrieve words and definitions from the database table, update a definition in the database table, and display a selected word�s definition.

Strategic Innovation: Building and Sustaining Innovative Organizations,https://www.coursera.org/learn/strategic-innovation-building-and-sustaining-innovative-organizations,"Innovation strategy is about creating unique value for consumers by delivering a great product that satisfies their needs and capturing value back from consumers.  At the core of a successful innovation strategy is a great product concept. Product is an all-encompassing term that includes physical goods, intangible services, and even ideas. There are three pillars to a successful product strategy: a clear understanding of (a) the target customers (WHO), (b) the specific elements of the product offering (WHAT) that satisfies consumer needs and dovetails with company capabilities, and (c) the tactical plans to reach end consumers (HOW). The value proposition has to be embedded in a coherent business model in order to create and capture value. But well-laid innovation plans can go awry without a consideration of the business ecosystem that includes competitors, collaborators, including suppliers, distributors, and retailers, or the contextual environment in which the company operates. In an interdependent world, fostering an integrated ecosystem is critically important for companies interested in maximizing the odds of innovation success.  Drawing from many years of research, this course will offer a set of frameworks, tools, and concepts in order to develop innovative strategies in a holistic way so as to achieve leadership positions.",4.8,4.5 total hours,Advanced,Paid,strateg innov build sustain innov organ,innov strategi creat uniqu valu consum deliv great product satisfi need captur valu back consum core success innov strategi great product concept product encompass term includ physic good intang servic even idea three pillar success product strategi clear understand target custom b specif element product offer satisfi consum need dovetail compani capabl c tactic plan reach end consum valu proposit embed coher busi model order creat captur valu well laid innov plan go awri without consider busi ecosystem includ competitor collabor includ supplier distributor retail contextu environ compani oper interdepend world foster integr ecosystem critic import compani interest maxim odd innov success draw mani year research cours offer set framework tool concept order develop innov strategi holist way achiev leadership posit

We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the �rise over run� formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck.

NoSQL is an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases sacrifice some relational databases characteristics, such as a well-defined structure and strict relations between entities, in order to achieve better and easier scaling and replication, to handle large quantities of data, while being more generally flexible, cheaper and easier to manage. Instead of using tables, rows and columns, NoSQL document databases such as MongoDB use collections, documents and fields, represented with the well known JSON format.

Those features will enable your tables to more efficiently manage data�while keeping your data safe and accurate.    Tables are great for data storage. The concept of organizing data in rows and columns is familiar to most people. Accountants use spreadsheets to organize financial data, making it easier to budget and track expenses. Parents use lists with columns to track their family�s schedules so that everyone gets to participate in outside activities. Even the Internal Revenue Service gets in the game by using tax tables to provide tax amounts for a variety of incomes. Even a simple grocery list is tabular in nature. Each row is an item, with one column having the item's name/description, and a second column noting the quantity needed. It�s no surprise that database designers like to use tables in a relational database to organize and store data. In the Design and Create a Relational Database Table Using SQLiteStudio course you learned about tables.

Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?  Most milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.  In this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.  Course lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week. The Dairy MOOC team thanks Dr. Antonio Branco (Universidade Estadual de Maring�, Brazil) and Ms. Yuanyuan Zhang (Pennsylvania State University) for translating the lecture materials.

There is a lot of hype around machine learning and many people are concerned that in order to use machine learning in business, you need to have a technical background. For reasons that are covered in this course, that's not the case. In actuality, your knowledge of your business is far more important than your ability to build an ML model from scratch.  By the end of this course, you will have learned how to: � Formulate machine learning solutions to real-world problems � Identify whether the data you have is sufficient for ML � Carry a project through various ML phases including training, evaluation, and deployment � Perform AI responsibly and avoid reinforcing existing bias � Discover ML use cases � Be successful at ML  You'll need a desktop web browser to run this course's interactive labs via Qwiklabs and Google Cloud Platform.  >>> By enrolling in this course you agree to the Qwiklabs Terms of Service as set out in the FAQ and located at: https://qwiklabs.com/terms_of_service <<<",4.6,7 total hours,Advanced,Free,machin learn busi profession,cours intend introduct machin learn non technic busi profession lot hype around machin learn mani peopl concern order use machin learn busi need technic background reason cover cours case actual knowledg busi far import abil build ml model scratch end cours learn formul machin learn solut real world problem identifi whether data suffici ml carri project variou ml phase includ train evalu deploy perform ai respons avoid reinforc exist bia discov ml use case success ml need desktop web browser run cours interact lab via qwiklab googl cloud platform enrol cours agre qwiklab term servic set faq locat http qwiklab com terms_of_servic
Burgos: Deciphering Secrets of Medieval Spain,https://www.coursera.org/learn/burgos-deciphering-secrets-medieval-spain,"This Advanced course focuses on two primary goals: (1) appraising how Jews, Christians, and Muslims shaped the history of medieval Spain and (2) mastering the craft of Spanish paleography, the skill of identifying Spanish handwriting in the 11th- through 15th-century manuscripts. Through the lens of the medieval history of Burgos, we dedicate 75% percent of our efforts to developing pragmatic expertise in the interpretation of Carolingian/French/Gothic handwriting.   Specifically, the course explores how the royal Castilian city of Burgos influenced, and was influenced by, Jews, Christians, and Muslims. We closely evaluate the Spanish Christian Reconquest, the Plague and the 14th-century Castilian civil war, anti-Jewish pogroms, the emergence of elite conversos (Jewish converts to Christianity), and the role of the king and Roman Catholic Church in the creation of Catholic Spain. Through onsite interviews in archives and museums in Burgos, we experience the medieval city, artifacts, and manuscripts. While we teach using Spanish manuscripts, very little or no knowledge of the Spanish language is necessary to complete the course.  Using an intensive array of paleography practices, exams, independent projects, and collaborative efforts, you will garner exceptional skills that you can apply to interpreting any medieval European handwriting. To demonstrate your mastery of paleography you will (1) create a 14th-15th-century alphabet, numeral, and abbreviation guide using manuscript images, and (2) transcribe one selection from a medieval manuscript.",4.2,2 total hours,Advanced,Free,burgo deciph secret mediev spain,advanc cours focus two primari goal 1 apprais jew christian muslim shape histori mediev spain 2 master craft spanish paleographi skill identifi spanish handwrit 11th 15th centuri manuscript len mediev histori burgo dedic 75 percent effort develop pragmat expertis interpret carolingian french gothic handwrit specif cours explor royal castilian citi burgo influenc influenc jew christian muslim close evalu spanish christian reconquest plagu 14th centuri castilian civil war anti jewish pogrom emerg elit converso jewish convert christian role king roman cathol church creation cathol spain onsit interview archiv museum burgo experi mediev citi artifact manuscript teach use spanish manuscript littl knowledg spanish languag necessari complet cours use intens array paleographi practic exam independ project collabor effort garner except skill appli interpret mediev european handwrit demonstr masteri paleographi 1 creat 14th 15th centuri alphabet numer abbrevi guid use manuscript imag 2 transcrib one select mediev manuscript

Cities are back in town : sociologie urbaine pour un monde globalis�,https://www.coursera.org/learn/developpement-urbain,"La mondialisation et l'europ�anisation favorisent le d�veloppement rapide des villes � travers le monde. L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd�hui avec l'essor des m�gacit�s (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou S�oul. Au-del� de la m�tropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens � ces grandes r�gions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que � post-m�tropoles �, � villes globales �, et � r�gions m�tropolitaines globales �. Ce cours passera en revue les d�bats et les mod�les de villes et m�tropoles actuels propos�s par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les d�veloppements contemporains. Comment �tudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des m�gar�gions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on � la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-del� de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des diff�renciations masqu�es et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner � ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unit�s ind�pendantes mais doivent �tre comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais �galement de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilit�, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales d�velopp�s en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'� quel point le d�veloppement syst�matique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire �voluer les sciences sociales et contribuer � surmonter la tendance � privil�gier les comparaisons entre nations ?  Pour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, �conomiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caract�ris�e par la taille, par l'agr�gation des logements, les divisions diff�renci�es du travail, et la densit� des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entrem�ler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent diff�rents processus d'int�gration : la ville mat�rielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses b�timents, ses d�chets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des diff�rences, des repr�sentations, des id�es, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esth�tiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de s�curit� sociale, d'�ducation ; la ville sociale des r�voltes, des in�galit�s ethniques, �conomiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l��conomie de la ville : la division du travail, l'�chelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce..... Les questions urbaines classiques portant sur les in�galit�s, le logement, le gouvernement, l'int�gration, se m�lent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilit� et l'enracinement, sur le d�veloppement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes � cyborg �, sur le contr�le social et les �meutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le d�veloppement �conomique urbain.

"Coexistence in Medieval Spain: Jews, Christians, and Muslims",https://www.coursera.org/learn/coexistence-in-medieval-spain,"This course explores Jewish, Christian, and Muslim intercultural relations in Iberia from the Visigothic era (6th century CE) until the creation of Queen Isabel I and King Ferdinand II Catholic Spain (late 15th century). We evaluate the many identities of the peninsula known as Christian Hispania, Jewish Sefarad, and Islamic al-Andalus. We trace the origins and trajectory of conflict between these communities (the Muslim conquest of Spain, Christian Reconquista, prohibitions blocking intermixing of peoples, and expulsions). We aim to understand conflicts within communities as well, such as the tensions between Christian Arian Visigoths and native Catholic Iberians or the fundamentalist North African Almohad Dynasty that rejected the Spanish Umayyad Caliphate�s preference for religious tolerance. We delve into an appreciation of collaboration and coexistence among these communities. We explore the unique role of the Jewish community who Muslims and Christians depended upon as political and cultural intermediaries as well as their intellectual collaborators. We find the history of how peoples attempted to create and manage viable diverse communities.

The Brain and Space,https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-brain,"This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.  Knowing where things are is effortless.  But �under the hood,� your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo � these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain�s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain�s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.  The material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called ""Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are"", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press.   The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.  Dr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D. Professor Psychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology Duke University  www.duke.edu/~jmgroh  Jennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled ""Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are"" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).  Much of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain�s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).  Dr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master�s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.  Dr. Groh�s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

A Business Approach to Sustainable Landscape Restoration,https://www.coursera.org/learn/landscape-restoration-sustainable-development,"Integrated landscape management and large-scale landscape restoration should be in every company�s business strategy because in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on Land Degradation Neutrality (SDG Number 15.3) scaling up and acceleration of business-driven landscape restoration is urgently needed.  This requires business professionals with a vision, the right knowledge and skills. This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business� interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.  �Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we�re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.�  T�a Obreht,  The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.  It is a frightening prospect indeed � that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed. This course is about landscape degradation � a global and wicked problem that is contributing to the dooming prospect of depletion of Earth�s finite resources. But this course is also about the solutions to this problem � business driven landscape restoration. So rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations.  We must act big and we must act now.

"The Power of Machine Learning: Boost Business, Accumulate Clicks, Fight Fraud, and Deny Deadbeats",https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-power-of-machine-learning,"It's the age of machine learning. Companies are seizing upon the power of this technology to combat risk, boost sales, cut costs, block fraud, streamline manufacturing, conquer spam, toughen crime fighting, and win elections.  Want to tap that potential? It�s best to start with a holistic, business-oriented course on machine learning � no matter whether you�re more on the tech or the business side. After all, successfully deploying machine learning relies on savvy business leadership just as much as it relies on technical skill. And for that reason, data scientists aren't the only ones who need to learn the fundamentals. Executives, decision makers, and line of business managers must also ramp up on how machine learning works and how it delivers business value.  And the reverse is true as well: Techies need to look beyond the number crunching itself and become deeply familiar with the business demands of machine learning. This way, both sides speak the same language and can collaborate effectively.  This course will prepare you to participate in the deployment of machine learning � whether you'll do so in the role of enterprise leader or quant. In order to serve both types, this course goes further than typical machine learning courses, which cover only the technical foundations and core quantitative techniques. This curriculum uniquely integrates both sides � both the business and tech know-how � that are essential for deploying machine learning. It covers:  � How launching machine learning � aka predictive analytics � improves marketing, financial services, fraud detection, and many other business operations  � A concrete yet accessible guide to predictive modeling methods, delving most deeply into decision trees  � Reporting on the predictive performance of machine learning and the profit it generates  � What your data needs to look like before applying machine learning  � Avoiding the hype and false promises of �artificial intelligence�  � The social justice concerns, such as when predictive models blatantly discriminate by protected class  NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. This concentrated entry-level program is totally accessible to business leaders � and yet totally vital to data scientists who want to secure their business relevance. It's for anyone who wishes to participate in the commercial deployment of machine learning, no matter whether you'll play a role on the business side or the technical side. This includes business professionals and decision makers of all kinds, such as executives, directors, line of business managers, and consultants � as well as data scientists.  BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It contextualizes the core technology, guiding you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy a predictive model so that it delivers a business impact.  LIKE A UNIVERSITY COURSE. This course is also a good fit for college students, or for those planning for or currently enrolled in an MBA program. The breadth and depth of the overall three-course specialization is equivalent to one full-semester MBA or graduate-level course.  IN-DEPTH YET ACCESSIBLE. Brought to you by industry leader Eric Siegel � a winner of teaching awards when he was a professor at Columbia University � this curriculum stands out as one of the most thorough, engaging, and surprisingly accessible on the subject of machine learning.

Explainable Machine Learning with LIME and H2O in R,https://www.coursera.org/learn/explainable-machine-learning-lime-h2o,"Welcome to this hands-on, guided introduction to Explainable Machine Learning with LIME and H2O in R. By the end of this project, you will be able to use the LIME and H2O packages in R for automatic and interpretable machine learning, build classification models quickly with H2O AutoML and explain and interpret model predictions using LIME.   Machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Machines, Neural Networks, Stacked Ensembles, etc., are often considered black boxes. However, they are more accurate for predicting non-linear phenomena due to their flexibility. Experts agree that higher accuracy often comes at the price of interpretability, which is critical to business adoption, trust, regulatory oversight (e.g., GDPR, Right to Explanation, etc.).  As more industries from healthcare to banking are adopting ML models, their predictions are being used to justify the cost of healthcare and for loan approvals or denials. For regulated industries that use machine learning, interpretability is a requirement.  As Finale Doshi-Velez and Been Kim put it, interpretability is ""The ability to explain or to present in understandable terms to a human."".  To successfully complete the project, we recommend that you have prior experience with programming in R, basic machine learning theory, and have trained ML models in R.

After the Arab Spring � Democratic Aspirations and State Failure,https://www.coursera.org/learn/after-the-arab-spring,"Learn why the hope and excitement of the Arab Spring is gone, why so many Arab states are falling apart, why the youth are so frustrated, why there are so many refugees, and what can be done about it.  The so-called Arab Spring appeared to end decades of exceptionalism and bring the Arab world back into the mainstream of global developments. The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.  Today, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?  This course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead �has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.� This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special.

Process Mining: Data science in Action,https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining,"Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.  Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as ""data science in action"".  The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.  This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.  The course covers the three main types of process mining.  1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.  2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.  3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.  Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between ""business"" and ""IT"". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.

Manipulating Data with SQL,https://www.coursera.org/learn/manipulating-data-with-sql,"In this course you will learn to write the SQL code to manipulate the data in a relational database table. You�ll begin by populating the table with data. Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database.   When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It�s much the same with designing and building database tables�the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.  As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you�ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You�ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you�ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike.   In addition to adding data to the tables, you�ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data. Managing and manipulating data are SQL�s primary purposes, and SQL coding will be a powerful addition to your tool set.

Introduction to Neuroeconomics: How the Brain Makes Decisions,https://www.coursera.org/learn/neuroeconomics,"Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of creating a single, general theory of human decision-making.   Neuroeconomics provides biologists, economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions and how others decide. Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.  The course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more Advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.  The course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam.

"Managing Responsibly: Practicing Sustainability, Responsibility and Ethics",https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsible-management,"Managers are increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability, responsibility and ethics. Managing responsibly is an integrative approach to sustainability, responsibility and ethics, which allows you as a manager to deal competently with such challenges. This course will facilitate your learning process to engage in changing practices to make them more sustainable, responsible, and ethically informed.  We will first introduce the context of the trend towards responsible management practices (week 1). We then explore the basics of each set of issues, sustainability (week 2), responsibility (week 3), and ethics (week 4). In week 5 you will work on your own responsible management issue/task and explore responsible management practices in an area of professional interest (e.g. strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation, organization, operations, supply chain, human resources, marketing and communication, international management, accounting and finance). In week 6 we will try to understand and experience what managing responsibly means in practice, including opportunities and challenges, and with a focus on transformative change. During these last two weeks you will work in a problem-oriented way, based on a challenging topic you have come across in your own management practice.  In the course we will form multicultural teams to learn about problems you bring forward. The course also facilitates the formation of peer networks that allow you to continue this learning experience after finishing the MOOC. The MOOC is an initiative in collaboration with the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative.  Overall Learning Outcomes 1) To provide an introduction to the three constituting fields of managing responsibly: sustainability, responsibility and ethics. 2) To help apply the knowledge and insights gained from these three fields to real life problems in your own setting. 3) To identify, understand and facilitate individual action that can lead to change at the organisational and system level ...to �act is to move� 4) To learn to appreciate and bring together different points of view, and negotiate collective solutions to pressing problems.  Who is this MOOC for? (Recommended Background) While this course is primarily designed for executives who want to work on particular responsible management issues and create responsible management practices, also Advanced business students will find it helpful.

Toledo: Deciphering Secrets of Medieval Spain,https://www.coursera.org/learn/toledo-deciphering-secrets-medieval-spain,"This course evaluates the medieval history of Toledo from the era of the Visigoth Kingdom (6th-8th centuries) through its Islamic period (8th to 11th centuries) and into its reintegration into Christian Spain (after 1085 c.e.) In particular, we take note of the cultural and religious transformations that characterized the city with a special effort to understand how many peoples and religions came to settle and live amongst one another. We will virtually-tour the Islamic and Christian structures of the Museo de Santa Cruz, Iglesia de San Rom�n, Sinagoga del Tr�nsito, Mezquita de Bab al-Mardum, Archivo Municipal de Toledo, and the Archivo Historico de la Nobleza.  We examine the Visigoths transition from Christian Arianism to Catholicism and the harsh treatment of the Jewish population. We explore Islamic governance and development of the medieval city of three faiths, with a special interest in its cultural achievements. We will study King Alfonso �The Wise� (1252-1284)�s efforts to characterize himself as the �king of three religions� via his legal codices, the creation of the Cantigas de Santa Mar�a, and his intellectual endeavor known as the Toledo School of Translators. We evaluate the robust Jewish and converso noble families of the city and appreciate their intellectual, religious, and economic contributions to Castilian life. We will bear witness to the rise of anti-Jewish blood purity statutes, the creation of the Inquisition, and the expulsion of the Jews.

Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-changes-mountains-water,"What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ?   Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base.   In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.  This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R�publique et Canton de Gen�ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.  By the end of this course, you will be able :  - to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions - to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies - to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions - to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health  - to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.  Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

Big Data Science with the BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center,https://www.coursera.org/learn/bd2k-lincs,"The Library of Integrative Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH Common Fund program. The idea is to perturb different types of human cells with many different types of perturbations such as: drugs and other small molecules; genetic manipulations such as knockdown or overexpression of single genes; manipulation of the extracellular microenvironment conditions, for example, growing cells on different surfaces, and more. These perturbations are applied to various types of human cells including induced pluripotent stem cells from patients, differentiated into various lineages such as neurons or cardiomyocytes. Then, to better understand the molecular networks that are affected by these perturbations, changes in level of many different variables are measured including: mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites, as well as cellular phenotypic changes such as changes in cell morphology.

Energy Within Environmental Constraints,https://www.edx.org/course/energy-within-environmental-constraints,"Humanity faces an immense challenge: providing abundant energy to everyone without wrecking the planet. If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. This course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won’t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance.

The motivating case study we examine in this course relates to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in Moneyball. We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs by using linear regression. We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, but it is not a magical process.

Rarely are all these wrangling steps necessary in a single analysis, but a data scientist will likely face them all at some point. Very rarely is data easily accessible in a data science project. It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling. This process is a critical step for any data scientist. Knowing how to wrangle and clean data will enable you to make critical insights that would otherwise be hidden.

Databases: Relational Databases and SQL,https://www.edx.org/course/databases-5-sql,"About the Database Series of Courses""Databases"" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. Relational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.Why Learn About DatabasesDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.Stanford's online offering in Databases is now available as a set of five self-paced courses:Databases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Advanced Topics in SQL (prerequisite: Relational Databases and SQL)Databases: OLAP and RecursionDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Semistructured Data Computer Science",4.0,3 total hours,Beginner,Free,databas relat databas sql,databas seri cours databas one stanford three inaugur massiv open onlin cours fall 2011 offer synchron self pace version varieti platform continu sinc 2011 materi offer set five self pace cours taken varieti way learn differ aspect databas relat databas sql popular cours databas seri applic learner seek gain strong understand relat databas master sql long accept standard queri languag relat databas system addit cours focu advanc concept relat databas sql formal foundat databas design methodolog semistructur data cours base around video lectur demo mani includ quizz video segment check understand depth standalon quizz varieti automat check interact exercis cours also includ unmoder discuss forum pointer read resourc cours describ briefli taught professor jennif widom overal curriculum draw stanford popular longstand databas cours learn databasesdatabas incred preval underli technolog use peopl everi day everi hour databas resid behind huge number websit crucial compon telecommun system bank system video game softwar system electron devic maintain amount persist inform addit persist databas system provid number properti make except use conveni reliabl effici scalabl concurr control data abstract high level queri languag databas ubiquit import comput scienc graduat frequent cite databas class one use industri graduat school career stanford onlin offer databas avail set five self pace cours databas relat databas sqldatabas advanc topic sql prerequisit relat databas sql databas olap recursiondatabas model theorydatabas semistructur data comput scienc

Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications,https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-understanding-its-uses-and-implications,"Blockchain technology is changing how business is executed. It's important to understand why blockchain is different and how it works in comparison with technologies of the past. The first segment of this course covers all the main concepts of what Blockchain is. It discusses how it began as a triple ledger system first introduced for the administration of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and how it is now applied to all aspects of business including government, banking, supply chains, and a host of other industries. It also analyzes the concept of transparent ledgers, both public and permissioned, and focuses on using cryptography to achieve consensus, immutability, and governance of transactions. This is all part of Blockchain's ability to provide ""trusted data from untrusted sources,"" disrupting traditional accounting methodologies and international trade. The course then dives into the various methods of blockchain governance that currently exist in the marketplace as well as how consensus fits into governance. It explores how to reach consensus through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Other aspects of the course include examining the very specific features of blockchain that solve problems that have been difficult to overcome in the past with more centralized architectures. The final part of the course takes a deep dive into the various use cases of blockchain, complete with analyzing real examples of how different industries are executing the technology and improving their business. Examining a problem, and then depicting a blockchain use case that solves the problem, will help gain an understanding of how blockchain is applied to real-world situations.

Work and Employment for a Sustainable Future,https://www.edx.org/course/work-and-employment-for-a-sustainable-future,"National economies have grown substantially since the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century yet people have not necessarily seen an increase in opportunities to find decent work or earn a decent income. In fact, in some places, the increased productivity and rising profits associated with automation have directly impacted the availability of decent jobs. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015, and more than 600 million new jobs are needed by 2030 just to keep pace with the growth of the working-age population. We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth.This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the world can achieve full and productive employment and decent work, for all women and men, by 2030.This seven-module massive open online course (MOOC) provides an in-depth look at the issues of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

Circular Economy for a Sustainable Built Environment,https://www.edx.org/course/circular-economy-for-a-sustainable-built-environ-2,"Building construction is one of the most waste producing sectors. In the European Union, construction alone accounts for approximately 30% of the raw material input. In addition, the different life-cycle stages of buildings, from construction to end-of-life, cause a significant environmental impact related to energy consumption, waste generation and direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. The Circular Economy model offers guidelines and principles for promoting more sustainable building construction and reducing the impact on our environment. If you are interested in taking your first steps in transitioning to a more sustainable manner of construction, then this course is for you! In this course you will become familiar with circularity as a systemic, multi-disciplinary approach, concerned with the different scale, from material to product, building, city, and region. Some aspects of circularity that will be included in this course are maximizing reuse and recycle levels by closing the material loops.

Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.Why Learn About DatabasesDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.Stanford's online offering in Databases is now available as a set of five self-paced courses:Databases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Advanced Topics in SQL (prerequisite: Relational Databases and SQL)Databases: OLAP and RecursionDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Semistructured Data Computer Science",4.5,4.5 total hours,Beginner,Free,databas advanc topic sql,databas seri cours databas one stanford three inaugur massiv open onlin cours fall 2011 offer synchron self pace version varieti platform continu sinc 2011 materi offer set five self pace cours taken varieti way learn differ aspect databas relat databas sql popular cours databas seri applic learner seek gain strong understand relat databas master sql long accept standard queri languag relat databas system addit cours focu advanc concept relat databas sql formal foundat databas design methodolog semistructur data cours base around video lectur demo mani includ quizz video segment check understand depth standalon quizz varieti automat check interact exercis cours also includ unmoder discuss forum pointer read resourc cours describ briefli taught professor jennif widom overal curriculum draw stanford popular longstand databas cours learn databasesdatabas incred preval underli technolog use peopl everi day everi hour databas resid behind huge number websit crucial compon telecommun system bank system video game softwar system electron devic maintain amount persist inform addit persist databas system provid number properti make except use conveni reliabl effici scalabl concurr control data abstract high level queri languag databas ubiquit import comput scienc graduat frequent cite databas class one use industri graduat school career stanford onlin offer databas avail set five self pace cours databas relat databas sqldatabas advanc topic sql prerequisit relat databas sql databas olap recursiondatabas model theorydatabas semistructur data comput scienc

The world population is growing and is projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050. How do we prepare for this and how are we going to be able to feed all these people? It is clear that the food production mainly has to come from improvements in agricultural water management on existing agricultural lands.Global climate change raises the pressure on supply and demand for water. Changing temperatures and long-term variation in annual precipitation amounts and regional distribution patterns require more ways to control water levels. In addition to the changing climate, cropping patterns are diversifying and field irrigation methods are changing. In light of all these changes in water demand, supply and use, the role of (subsurface) drainage has changed from a single-purpose measure for controlling waterlogging and/or salinity to an essential element of integrated water management under multiple land use scenarios.Join this course to advance your knowledge in drainage, drainage systems and solutions, and to help securing a sustainable food supply. In this course, you will work on different modules, apply the knowledge gained directly to your home country drainage situation. Furthermore, you will learn from other cases and learners worldwide, expanding your horizon on the global importance of drainage.Structure of the courseThe course consists of five modules. In Module 1, the need for drainage, the drainage methods and the design approaches for agricultural drainage systems are introduced. In Module 2 you will learn more about the hydrological principles related to drainage and drainage design equations. Module 3 discusses the general aspects of drainage of saline and sodic soils and Module 4 is an introduction to the implementation and operation & maintenance of drainage systems. Depending on your background and interest, you may decide by yourself in which sequence you do these three modules. But you should realize that in Module 5, all these different aspects of drainage are integrated to discuss the changing role of drainage in agricultural water management.For who This course was developed for professionals and students from various backgrounds, especially those who are interested in agricultural water management and want to broaden their understanding of drainage planning, design, and management, and drainage-related research and training. Although specifically watermanagers and waterengineers, agricultural engineers, irrigation professionals, hydrologists, and agricultural policy makers join this course, the course is open and accessible to everyone.Do not miss out on the opportunity to join this free online course and upgrade your knowledge on drainage for agricultural lands.

Co-Creating Sustainable Cities,https://www.edx.org/course/co-creating-sustainable-cities,"Around the world, major challenges of our time such as population growth and climate change are being addressed in cities. Here, citizens play an important role amidst governments, companies, NGOs and researchers in creating social, technological and political innovations for achieving sustainability.Citizens can be co-creators of sustainable cities when they engage in city politics or in the design of the urban environment and its technologies and infrastructure. In addition, citizens influence and are influenced by the technologies and systems that they use every day. Sustainability is thus a result of the interplay between technology, policy and people’s daily lives. Understanding this interplay is essential for creating sustainable cities. In this MOOC, we zoom in on Amsterdam, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Nairobi, Kampala and Suzhou as living labs for exploring the dynamics of co-creation for sustainable cities worldwide. We will address topics such as participative democracy and legitimacy, ICTs and big data, infrastructure and technology, and SMART technologies in daily life.This global scope will be used to illustrate why specific forms of co-creation are preferred in specific urban contexts. Moreover, we will investigate and compare these cities on three themes that have a vast effect on city life:This MOOC will teach you about the dynamics of co-creation and the key principles of citizens interacting with service providing companies, technology and infrastructure developers, policy makers and researchers. You will gain an understanding of major types of co-creation and their interdependency with their socio-technical and political contexts. You will become equipped to indicate how you can use co-creation to develop innovative technologies, policy arrangements or social practices for a sustainable city in your own community. You will demonstrate this by developing an action plan, research proposal or project idea.Basic knowledge of sustainability in urban settings, urban environmental technology and urban management is assumed.

Sustainable Packaging in a Circular Economy,https://www.edx.org/course/sustainable-packaging-in-a-circular-economy,"It has become almost impossible to imagine what our lives would be like without the many benefits of packaging - just think about the different packaging and single-use items you use on a daily basis. Yet as our global population grows in size and affluence, both our collective demand for packaging materials and the waste we generate as a result will increasedramatically. Currently, large amounts of packaging waste escape formal collection and recycling systems and eventually end up polluting the environment. Moreover, their material value is forever lost to the economy. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that uncollected plastic packaging waste alone is worth somewhere between 80 to 120 billion dollars a year. So how can we improve packaging systems in order to capture this wasted potential? Clearly, the way we currently design, recover, and reuse packaging urgently needs a rethink! In this course, you will learn about the design of sustainable packaging systems. To do so we will explore the design and business strategies of the circular economy. Contrary to our current industrial model, which extracts, uses and ultimately disposes of resources, a circular economy is regenerative by design. This means that products and services are reimagined from a systems perspective in order to minimize waste, maximize positive economic, environmental and social impacts, and keep resources locked in a cycle of restoration. This course is for you if you are interested in learning about sustainable packaging design. You'll also benefit if you are a professional in the packaging industry and want to learn how to find circular opportunities in your work.

Data Science: Inferential Thinking through Simulations,https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-data-science-inferential-thinking-b,"Using real-world examples from a wide range of domains including law, medicine, and football, you’ll learn how data scientists make conclusions about unknowns based on the data available.Often, the data we have are not complete, yet we’d still like to draw inferences about the world and quantify the uncertainty in our conclusions. This is called statistical inference. In this course, you will learn the framework for statistical inference and apply them to real-world data sets.Notably, you will learn how to conduct hypothesis testing—comparing theoretical predictions to actual data, and choosing whether to accept those predictions. You will utilize the power of computation to conduct simulations by which you can evaluate theories or hypotheses about how the world works. This course will teach you the power of statistical inference: given a random sample, how do we predict some quantity that we cannot observe directly?You will also learn how to by quantifying the uncertainty in the conclusions you draw from hypothesis testing. This helps assess whether patterns that appear to be present in the data actually represent a true relationship in the world, or whether they might merely reflect random fluctuations due to chance. Throughout this course, we will go over multiple methods for estimation and hypothesis testing, based on simulations and the bootstrap method. Finally, you will learn about randomized controlled experiments and how to draw conclusions about causality.The course emphasizes the conceptual basis of inference, the logic of the decision-making process, and the sound interpretation of results.

Decision Making Under Uncertainty: Introduction to Structured Expert Judgment,https://www.edx.org/course/decision-making-under-uncertainty-introduction-to,"In an increasingly data-driven world, data and its use aren't always all it's cracked up to be. This course aims to address the critical lack of any or appropriate data in many areas where complex decisions need to be made. For instance, how can you predict volcano activity when no eruptions have been recorded over a long period of time? Or how can you predict how many people will be resistant to antibiotics in a country where there is no available data at national level? Or how about estimating the time needed to evacuate people in flood risk areas? In situations like these, expert opinions are needed to address complex decision-making problems. This course, aimed at researchers and professionals from any academic background, will show you how expert opinion can be used for uncertainty quantification in a rigorous manner. Various techniques are used in practice. They vary from the informal and undocumented opinion of one expert to a fully documented and formal elicitation of a panel of experts, whose uncertainty assessments can be aggregated to provide support for complex decision making. In this course you will be introduced to state-of-the-art expert judgment methods, particularly the Classical Model (CM) or Cooke's method, which is arguably the most rigorous method for performing Structured Expert Judgment. CM, developed at TU Delft by Roger Cooke, has been successfully applied for over 30 years in areas as diverse as climate change, disaster management, epidemiology, public and global health, ecology, aeronautics/aerospace, nuclear safety, environment and ecology, engineering and many others.By the end of the course all learners will be able to: Verified learners will have the added benefit of being able to:  Business & Management",4.7,8.5 total hours,Beginner,Free,decis make uncertainti introduct structur expert judgment,increasingli data driven world data use alway crack cours aim address critic lack appropri data mani area complex decis need made instanc predict volcano activ erupt record long period time predict mani peopl resist antibiot countri avail data nation level estim time need evacu peopl flood risk area situat like expert opinion need address complex decis make problem cours aim research profession academ background show expert opinion use uncertainti quantif rigor manner variou techniqu use practic vari inform undocu opinion one expert fulli document formal elicit panel expert whose uncertainti assess aggreg provid support complex decis make cours introduc state art expert judgment method particularli classic model cm cook method arguabl rigor method perform structur expert judgment cm develop tu delft roger cook success appli 30 year area divers climat chang disast manag epidemiolog public global health ecolog aeronaut aerospac nuclear safeti environ ecolog engin mani other end cours learner abl verifi learner ad benefit abl busi manag
